{"name":"seriousbiz","tagline":"Serious business only.","body":"# Game of the Month Club\r\n\r\n##January\r\nThis inagural month features a \"maze\" theme.  Submit a brief proposal by Friday, Jan 9th, with a \"Shift + Ship It\" date of Saturday, Jan 31st.  Good luck.\r\n\r\n###Proposals:\r\n\r\n####Andy\r\nI propose to build a maze game where a ping pong ball has to be paddled through a procedurally-generated maze.  At each corner, the player must hit an arrow key to strike the ball in a direction.  Or maybe the player has to place ping pong players and/or paddles throughout the maze, and then use them to hit the ball.\r\n\r\n####Michael\r\nWhat if you were trying to guide a ball in a 2D maze, but gravity was involved? And maybe the ball is bouncy? And maybe you can rotate the board (to change the direction that gavity is pulling the ball)? I make no promises that this game will be any fun.\r\n\r\n####Jason\r\nFirst person mouse seeking cheese.  Somehow you'll have to use the power of your just-visible mouse nose to successfully guide you through the maze to the cheese.\r\n\r\n####Franco&trade;\r\nA Tron-bike like game (single player). The moto will steer in arcs and not with the classic 90deg pattern. Also walls will randomly appear from time to time.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
