<p>This inagural month features a "maze" theme.  Submit a brief proposal by Friday, Jan 9th, with a "Shift + Ship It" date of Saturday, Jan 31st.  Good luck.</p>

<p>I propose to build a maze game where a ping pong ball has to be paddled through a procedurally-generated maze.  At each corner, the player must hit an arrow key to strike the ball in a direction.  Or maybe the player has to place ping pong players and/or paddles throughout the maze, and then use them to hit the ball.</p>

<p>2D side-scrolling maze with gravity. You possess a jetpack to help you go back up, but it has limited fuel/charge. Either the jetpack slowly recharges over time (so you'll never be totally stuck, but the goal is to complete the maze as quickly and efficiently as possible) or you need to collect fuel to refuel the jetpack. As a bonus, the map could randomly rotate every now and then (changing the direction of gravity).</p>

<p>First person mouse seeking cheese.  Somehow you'll have to use the power of your just-visible mouse nose to successfully guide you through the maze to the cheese.</p>

<p>A Tron-bike like game (single player). The moto will steer in arcs and not with the classic 90deg pattern. Also walls will randomly appear from time to time.</p>
